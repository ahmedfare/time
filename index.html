    Time management is the coordination of tasks and activities to maximize the effectiveness of an individual's efforts. Essentially, the purpose of time management is to enable people to get more and better work done in less time.
The importance of time management is in its ability to assign meaning to time, letting people make the most of their time. In a business context, it is used to set goals and expectations for companies and their employees. Good time management skills help employees deliver quality work and meet their goals effectively. Time management also helps managers to understand what employees are capable of and to set realistic goals.
